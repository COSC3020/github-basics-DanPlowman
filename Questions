I have completed the reading for the Github basics, but still have a few questions as I have never actually used Github before. 
Just to be clear, when we go to the main repository and select an exercise, we then create a fork for ourselves to use
once we are ready to submit the code for review, we then submit a pull request, which either Lars or Ali will see and review,
marking it as complete or providing feedback on what needs to be changed? 

In completing this exercise I believe I have answered these questions myself, but would rather hear it from the people in charge 
rather than assuming I have these details correct.
